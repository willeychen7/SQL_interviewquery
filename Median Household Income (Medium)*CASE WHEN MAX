A marketing company is conducting a survey on household incomes in various cities. 
Now theyâ€™re asking for your help with analytics.
Write a SQL query to compute the median household income for each city.

Note: Assume that the median is the middle value in an odd set of numbers, and the average of the two middle numbers in an even set.

Example:
Input:
survey_responses table
----------------------------+
Column	          | Type    |
----------------------------+
id	              | INTEGER |
city	            | VARCHAR |
household_income	| INTEGER |
----------------------------+

Output:
------------------------+
Column	      | Type    |
------------------------+
city	        | VARCHAR |
median_income	| INTEGER |
------------------------+


SOLUTION 1 (MAX CASE WHEN)
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        city,
        household_income,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY household_income ASC) as income_rank,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY city) as total_rows
    FROM survey_responses
)

SELECT
    city,
    CASE
        WHEN total_rows % 2 = 1 THEN
            MAX(CASE WHEN income_rank = (total_rows + 1) / 2 THEN household_income END)
        ELSE
            (MAX(CASE WHEN income_rank = total_rows / 2 THEN household_income END) +
             MAX(CASE WHEN income_rank = (total_rows / 2) + 1 THEN household_income END)) / 2
    END AS median_income
FROM CTE
GROUP BY city, total_rows;


SOLUTION 2 (SELECTb(SELECT
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        city,
        household_income,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY household_income ASC) as income_rank,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY city) as total_rows
    FROM survey_responses
)

SELECT
    city,
    CASE
        WHEN total_rows % 2 = 1 THEN
            (SELECT household_income 
             FROM CTE AS sub 
             WHERE sub.city = cte.city AND sub.income_rank = (total_rows + 1) / 2)
        ELSE
            ( (SELECT household_income 
                FROM CTE AS sub1 
                WHERE sub1.city = cte.city AND sub1.income_rank = total_rows / 2) + 
              (SELECT household_income 
                FROM CTE AS sub2 
                WHERE sub2.city = cte.city AND sub2.income_rank = (total_rows / 2) + 1)
            ) / 2
    END AS median_income
FROM CTE
GROUP BY city, total_rows;
