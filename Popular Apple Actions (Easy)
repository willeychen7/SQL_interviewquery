Write a query to determine the top 5 actions performed during 
1. "the month of November 2020",
2. for "actions" performed on an Apple "platform (iPhone, iPad)".

The events table tracks every time a user performs a certain action (like post_enter, etc.) on a platform (android, web, etc.).
The output should include the action performed and itâ€™s rank in "ascending order". 
If two actions are performed "equally", they should have the "same rank". 

Example:

Input:
events table
-----------------------
Column	    | Type
user_id     |	INTEGER
created_at	| DATETIME
action    	| VARCHAR
platform  	| VARCHAR
-----------------------
Output:
Column	Type
action	VARCHAR
ranks	INTEGER


SOLUTION
SELECT
    action,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(action) DESC) AS ranks
FROM events
WHERE 
     platform IN ('iphone', 'ipad') AND 
    YEAR(created_at) = 2020 AND
    MONTH(created_at) = 11
GROUP BY action
LIMIT 5
