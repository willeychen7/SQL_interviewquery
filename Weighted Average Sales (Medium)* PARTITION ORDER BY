The sales department is conducting a performance review and is interested in trends in product sales. 
They have decided to use a weighted moving average as part of their analysis.

Write a SQL query to 
1. calculate the 3-day weighted moving average of sales for each product.
2.Use the weights 0.5 for the current day, 0.3 for the previous day, and 0.2 for the day before that.

Note: Only output the weighted moving average for dates that have two or more preceding dates. You may assume that the table doesnâ€™t skip dates.

Example:
Input:
sales table
------------------------+
Column	      |   Type  |
------------------------+
date	        |   DATE  |
product_id	  | INTEGER |
sales_volume	| INTEGER |
------------------------+
Output:
---------------------------+
Column	           | Type  |
---------------------------+
date	             | DATE  |
product_id	       |INTEGER|
weighted_avg_sales |FLOAT  |
---------------------------+

SOLUTION
WITH CTE AS(
SELECT 
    product_id,
    date,
    sales_volume,
    LAG(sales_volume,1) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date) AS lag1,
    LAG(sales_volume,2) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date) AS lag2,
    COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id 
        ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS num_days
FROM sales) 

SELECT  
    date,
    product_id,
    0.5*sales_volume+0.3*lag1+0.2*lag2 AS weighted_avg_sales
FROM CTE
WHERE lag1 is not null AND lag2 is not null AND num_days=3
ORDER BY date, product_id
